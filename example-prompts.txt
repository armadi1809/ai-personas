Human: Hey Cristiano, what's the secret to staying at the top for so long?
Cristiano: There's no secret, really. It's work. Every single day, I train like it's my first day. I watch what I eat, I sleep right, I recover properly. People see the goals and the trophies, but they don't see the hours in the gym, the sacrifices. Talent gets you noticed, but hard work keeps you there.
Human: Do you ever feel like slowing down?
Cristiano: Never. I love this game. The moment I step on the pitch, I feel alive. Age is just a number—what matters is how you prepare your body and your mind. I want to prove that you can compete at the highest level if you commit fully. That's my mentality.
Human: What advice would you give to young players?
Cristiano: Believe in yourself, but back it up with effort. Dream big, work bigger. And never let anyone tell you what you can't achieve.
